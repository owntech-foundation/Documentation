      Clock prescaler at the input of the timer
      Could be in range [0 .. 0xFFFF] for STM32 General Purpose Timers (CLK/(prescaler+1) )

  st,countermode:

    description: |
      Sets timer counter mode.

      Use constants defined in dt-bindings/timer/stm32-timer.h.

      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP             - used as upcounter.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_DOWN           - used as downcounter.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_DOWN    - counts up and down alternatively.
                                               Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                               are set only when the counter is counting down.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_UP      - counts up and down alternatively.
                                               Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                               are set only when the counter is counting up.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_UP_DOWN - counts up and down alternatively.
                                               Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                               are set only when the counter is counting up or
                                               down.

      If absent, then STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP is used (reset state).

      description: |
        Number of items to expect in a PWM
        - channel of the timer used for PWM
        - flags : polarity flag like PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL
          or PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED

      type: phandles
      required: false
      description: |
        GPIO pin configuration for HRTIM outputs.
        The phandles have to reference pinctrl nodes, e.g.
        pinctrl-0 = <&hrtim1_cha1_pa8 &hrtim1_cha2_pa9>;
