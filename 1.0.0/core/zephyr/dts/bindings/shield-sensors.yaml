description: List of a shield sensors that can be acquired by Spin ADCs

compatible: "shield-sensors"

properties:
  sensor-name:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Name under which the sensor will be referred to in user code.

  default-gain:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: Value of the gain (multiplication to be applied on the raw measured value).
                 The value represents a float32_t, thus is stored in IEEE754 format.

  default-offset:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: Value of the offset (to be added after the raw value has been multiplied by the gain).
                 The value represents a float32_t, thus is stored in IEEE754 format.

  default-R0:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: Value of the resistance of the thermistor at a reference temperature.

  default-B:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: Value of the coefficient of resistance change with temperature of the thermistor
                 material.

  default-RDIV:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: Value of the resistance used in the bridge to condition the temperature measurement.

  default-T0:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: Value of the offset (to be added after the raw value has been multiplied by the gain).
                 The value represents a float32_t, thus is stored in IEEE754 format.

  sensor-conv-type:
    type: string
    required: false
    description: Type of conversion performed by the sensor. Typically LINEAR or LOG. 

child-binding:

  description: Sensor node ADC info

  properties:

    io-channels:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: ADC number and channel description.

    spin-pin:
      type: int
      required: true

    differential:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: Set the channel to differential mode. Default is Single Ended.
