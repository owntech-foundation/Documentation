	 * @param[in] pin_number Number of the Spin pin on which to enable acquisition.
	 * @param[in] adc_number Number of the ADC on which acquisition is to be done.
	 *            This parameter can be omitted, in which case:
	 *            - If only one ADC is linked to the given pin, it will be selected.
	 *            - If two ADCs are available for acquisition on the given pin, the
	 *            ADC with the lowest number will be selected.
	 *
	 * @return 0 if acquisition was correctly enabled, -1 if there was an error.
	 *         Errors generally indicate that the given pin is not linked to and
	 *         ADC, and thus can not be used for acquisition. If the adc_number
	 *         parameter was explicitely provided, it can also indicate that the
